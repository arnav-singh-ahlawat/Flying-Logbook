# Flying Logbook

## Overview:

Flying Logbook is a Python Tkinter application developed to streamline the process of recording flight details, inspired by the common practice among Indian Air Force pilots, including my brother, of manually logging flight information in traditional logbooks.

This application modernizes the process by storing flight data in a MySQL database, offering centralized management and easy access to records.

## Features:

**Centralized Database:** Flight Log Manager utilizes a MySQL database to store flight data, ensuring centralized management and easy retrieval.

**Intuitive Interface:** The application offers a user-friendly interface designed with Tkinter, enabling users to conveniently add, edit, remove, and sort flight entries.

**Efficient Management:** Pilots and aviation enthusiasts can efficiently manage their flight records, reducing the time and effort required for manual logkeeping.

**Customizable Sorting:** Users have the flexibility to sort flight entries based on various parameters such as date, duration, aircraft type, and more.

**Data Security:** Flight Log Manager prioritizes data security by implementing secure authentication mechanisms and encryption protocols to safeguard sensitive flight information.

## Getting Started:

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Compile the *app.py* file using your preferred Python IDE or command line.

**Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have Python and MySQL installed on your system. Install required Python packages using "pip install -r requirements.txt".

**Database Configuration:** Configure MySQL database settings in accordance to the *_Database.png* image I have appended in my repository.

## Run the Application:
